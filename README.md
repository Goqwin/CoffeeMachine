# Miniprojects
Numerous side projects prompts that are taken from numerous published sites. Purely Educational + Free Use purposes. Please read Readme + License
This repository contains all the mini-projects I've worked on using Python Code. This is no way to profit off my code but purely for creative purposes. Feel free to enhance my code: I will be updating this readme the more projects I take on.
